### Hi there My name is Jihyun KimðŸ‘‹

I am currently a PhD student in Statistics. Plus I have a master degree and bachelor degree in Statistics. That is over 10 years of Statistics.âœ¨

I specialize at survival analysis on group-tested/arbitrarily censored data. Creating computationally-efficient stratigies, checking the perfomance with simulation studies, and real data applications are what I do for my research.

In the meanwhile, I like to explore data with various tools!
